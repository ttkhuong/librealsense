# test:device D400* !D405
# test:donotrun:!nightly
# test:timeout 300

# Test master-slave synchronization with calibrated frame time
# Requirements:
#   - Two D400 cameras connected (D405 excluded as it lacks sync port)
#   - Cameras connected via sync cable
#   - FW version >= 5.15.0.0 for inter_cam_sync_mode support
# 
# Configuration:
#   - CALIBRATION_DURATION: Duration for calibration phase (default: 5 seconds)
#   - DRIFT_TEST_DURATION: Duration in seconds for drift measurement (default: 90 seconds)
#   - ENABLE_DRIFT_PLOT: Enable matplotlib plotting of drift analysis (default: False)
#   - MASTER_SLAVE_OFFSET_THRESHOLD_MAX: Maximum first segment offset for MASTER-SLAVE mode (default: 20 us)
#   - MASTER_SLAVE_DRIFT_RATE_THRESHOLD_MAX: Maximum drift rate for MASTER-SLAVE mode (default: 20 us/minute)
#   - DEFAULT_OFFSET_THRESHOLD_MIN: Minimum first segment offset for DEFAULT mode (default: 100 us)
#   - DEFAULT_DRIFT_RATE_THRESHOLD_MIN: Minimum drift rate for DEFAULT mode (default: 100 us/minute)
#
# Test flow:
#   1. Hardware reset both cameras to clean state -> hardware timestamp counters reset to 0
#   2. Test MASTER-SLAVE mode:
#      - Configure one camera as MASTER, other as SLAVE
#      - Calibration phase (slave HW timestamp vs master HW timestamp in MASTER-SLAVE mode):
#        * Discard first 1 second of frames to allow streams to stabilize
#        * Collect frames simultaneously from both cameras
#        * Align frames based on system timestamps (within 33ms)
#        * Use linear regression to find: slave_hw_ts = slope * master_hw_ts + offset
#        * This captures the relationship between the two hardware clocks
#      - Stream synchronized depth frames at 640x480@30fps
#      - Transform slave HW timestamps to master's domain: slave_in_master_domain = (slave_hw_ts - offset) / slope
#      - Analyze drift as difference between master HW timestamp and transformed slave timestamp
#   3. Test DEFAULT mode:
#      - Configure both cameras to DEFAULT sync mode
#      - Use same calibration from MASTER-SLAVE mode
#      - Perform same data collection and analysis with transformed timestamps
#   4. Compare MASTER-SLAVE vs DEFAULT modes:
#      - Generate 2-panel comparison plot (HW Timestamp Offset and Drift Rate)
#      - Validate MASTER-SLAVE mode meets synchronization thresholds
#      - Validate DEFAULT mode shows expected poor synchronization
#
# Drift Analysis Methodology:
#   - Calibration: Performed once in MASTER-SLAVE mode, used for both tests
#     * Discard first 1 second of frames to allow streams to stabilize
#     * Use linear regression: slave_hw_ts = slope * master_hw_ts + offset
#     * Captures the relationship between the two hardware clocks
#     * Same calibration used for both MASTER-SLAVE and DEFAULT mode tests
#   - Transform slave to master's domain: slave_in_master_domain = (slave_hw_ts - offset) / slope
#   - Frame alignment: Pairs frames based on transformed HW timestamps with 30% of frame time threshold (~10ms at 30fps)
#     * Match quality stored for each aligned pair (HW timestamp difference in master's domain)
#   - Quality filtering: Strict 30% of frame time threshold applied during analysis to ensure high-quality statistics
#   - Outlier removal: IQR method (1.5×IQR) applied to offset values to reduce stability spikes from transient anomalies
#   - HW timestamp offset: Absolute difference between master HW timestamp and slave in master's domain
#     * First segment offset should be near zero in MASTER-SLAVE mode (well synchronized)
#     * DEFAULT mode offset shows how much cameras drift without hardware sync
#   - Segments: Analysis divided into 10-second segments for trend observation
#   - Drift rate: Change in HW timestamp offset per minute
#
# Notes:
#   - Hardware timestamp is 32-bit (uint32_t) with microsecond resolution (1 MHz counter)
#   - Hardware timestamp wraps around after ~4,294 seconds (approximately 71.5 minutes)
#   - Test duration limited to 90 seconds per drift test for quicker validation
#   - Total test time: 1 calibration (10s) + 2 drift tests (180s) = ~3 minutes
#   - Single calibration performed in MASTER-SLAVE mode, used for both drift tests
#   - Calibration uses system timestamps for frame alignment (within 33ms)
#   - Drift measurement uses transformed HW timestamps for frame alignment (30% of frame time = ~10ms at 30fps)
#   - Strict match quality filter (30% of frame time) ensures high-quality statistics
#   - Calibration uses linear regression to account for both offset and clock rate differences
#   - Slope close to 1.0 indicates hardware clocks running at similar rates
#   - Slave timestamps transformed to master's domain for direct comparison
#   - All calculations use double precision (Python float is 64-bit IEEE 754)
#   - Test duration configurable via DRIFT_TEST_DURATION
#   - Test runs nightly only due to extended duration
#   - Pass/fail thresholds configurable via MASTER_SLAVE_*_THRESHOLD_MAX and DEFAULT_*_THRESHOLD_MIN
#   - Comparison validates MASTER-SLAVE mode provides better synchronization than DEFAULT
